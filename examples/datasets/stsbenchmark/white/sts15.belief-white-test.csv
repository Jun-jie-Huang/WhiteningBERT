PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	4.00	i agree with others ( and yourself ) in that i have never heard this phrase in english .	i have never heard or seen the phrase you mention .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	0.60	the assertion is false , at least as you 've restated it here .	" i had mainly been " is fine , in the context you 're using it .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	2.80	i 'd suggest you look to the constructions of the native language ( s ) of your students .	as bikeboy389 said , you can learn a lot by looking at students ' native languages .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	2.60	i see some references to status as uncountable as well , but that doesn 't make much sense to me .	there are some cases " status " may be accounted of countable .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	2.60	if i understand you correctly , you are looking for a hypernym of inclusion and exclusion .	inclusion is the act of including and exclusion is the act of excluding .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	0.60	firstly , you should be aware that there are two different kinds of dashes : the en dash and the em dash .	semicolon is used to join sentences that can stand alone , but are joined to emphasize their relationship .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	4.40	pardon the brevity of this answer , but i would say " named " is preferred within the context of your example .	named is preferred in your example , since you are formally giving a name to your method .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	2.20	in standard english , i think " don 't got " has the same register as " ain 't " .	i 'd say the expression i don 't got ... is generally rare in spoken ame .

PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	1.80	i can only think of context using insofar as or insofar that .	the form insofar is american english ; the standard form in british and other english is ' in so far ' .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	3.80	as others have said , " ten of six " , though not used in many english speaking areas , would be understood as 5 : 50 .	" ten of six " probably means 5 : 50 but i have not heard it before .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	3.00	certainly many usage guides have advised against use of this " singular they " on various " logical " grounds .	second one ( for writing purpose ) , if i believe the " they / their ( singular ) " article .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	1.40	this may be overly obvious , but in american english , saying " you 're welcome " is certainly polite and standard .	i 'm not sure how " not at all " sounds in response to " thank you " .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	3.00	back in the day , " cable " was used to describe communications sent abroad .	the word " cable " has its origins in the days of the telegraph .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	0.40	those expressions could have slightly different meanings especially when talking about finance .	i suspect the phrase originated in the habit of drawing the internet as a cloud shape on network diagrams .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	3.60	in the united states , jails are operated by cities and counties ( or equivalent ) .	jail is a municipal level , prison is on a state / federal / provincial / territory level .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	3.40	yes , your sentence will be clearer if you write the actual word instead of the slash .	most style guides recommend against using the slash in phrases like “ x and / or y ” , as well as “ this is hard / impossible to do ” .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	2.80	if you understand yourself and your enemy , you will be far more likely to win any battle .	another meaning behind this quote aside from probabilities of winning a theoretical battle is the importance of knowing / understanding others .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	4.20	there are a lot of push up variations you can do and they all stress different muscle systems .	there are several different pushup variations out there and most of them provide a unique advantage .

PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	1.80	yes , you should stretch before running , but not the sit down and reach kind of stretching .	neuromuscular activation and dynamic stretching here is an excellent video on a dynamic stretching routine for running .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	1.00	i feel your pain - i absolutely pour with sweat with any vigorous exercise , even in cool conditions .	sweat rate is sweat rate , you can 't really control it .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	2.00	running downhill is the best way to strengthen your quad muscles .	additionally often people will think a downhill marathon is easier , but in fact , is often harder than an uphill marathon .
PAD	PAD	PAD	PAD	1.00	i recently stumbled on a great article that talks about protein consumption for the purposes of building muscle ( recovery included ) .	low reps with high weights don 't add mass because the duration of the exercise is kept short .
